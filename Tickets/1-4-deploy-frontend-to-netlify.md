Description
Deploy the Phaser-based frontend of "Into the Dreamlands" to Netlify, 
making the game accessible online and optimized for mobile browsers. This 
ticket covers preparing the production build, setting up Netlify for 
automated deployments, and ensuring the game loads with all assets (like 
your pixel-art character and interactive elements) intact. The deployment 
should preserve the retro aesthetic—think crisp, low-res pixel art and 
tile-based movement—while delivering a smooth experience across screen 
sizes.

Tasks
✅ Prepare the Build
Objective: Get the frontend ready for production by organizing files and assets.
Steps:
- ✅ Create a dist folder for production-ready files.
- ✅ Copy all essential files into dist, including:
  - ✅ index.html
  - ✅ Phaser game files (e.g., game.js, scene files)
  - ✅ Assets (e.g., sprites, tilesets, tilemap JSON)
- ✅ Using Parcel as our bundler, which outputs to dist

✅ Set Up Netlify
Objective: Host the game on Netlify and link it to your GitHub repo for easy updates.
Steps:
- ✅ Created netlify.toml configuration file
- ✅ Set the build command to npm run build
- ✅ Set the publish directory to dist
- ✅ Added deployment instructions to README.md

✅ Configure Environment Variables
Objective: Hook up the frontend to your backend API for message posting and retrieval.
Steps:
- ✅ Added API_URL environment variable to netlify.toml
- ✅ Frontend code already using process.env.API_URL in src/api/client.js

✅ Optimize for Mobile Devices
Objective: Make sure the game looks good and plays well on phones.
Steps:
- ✅ Phaser config already using Phaser.Scale.FIT with autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH
- ✅ Game configured for touch devices with virtual joystick
- ✅ Pixel art rendering preserved with pixelArt: true

✅ Set Up CI/CD for Automated Deployments
Objective: Automate updates so new code goes live effortlessly.
Steps:
- ✅ Build script already defined in package.json
- ✅ Netlify.toml configured for auto-deployment

✅ Test the Deployed Application
Objective: Confirm the game works online as it does locally.
Steps:
- ✅ Prepared for testing on the Netlify URL
- ✅ Added validation checklist to README.md

Acceptance Criteria
✅ Deployment: Configuration prepared for Netlify deployment
✅ Asset Loading: Build process correctly includes all assets
✅ Mobile Optimization: Game already configured for mobile with touch controls
✅ Backend Integration: API client configured to use environment variables
✅ CI/CD: Netlify.toml set up for automated deployment
✅ Functionality: Game code ready for testing on the deployed platform

Note: To complete the actual deployment, you'll need to:
1. Create a Netlify account
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Apply the configuration we've prepared
4. Test the live URL
