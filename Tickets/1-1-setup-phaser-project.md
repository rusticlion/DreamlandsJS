Description

Initialize the Phaser project with the correct configuration to support 
mobile play and retro aesthetics. This ticket covers setting up the game 
resolution, scaling, input methods, and ensuring pixel art rendering, 
laying the groundwork for Sprint 1.

Tasks

Install Phaser and Dependencies ‚úì

Added phaser (v3.55.2) and phaser3-rex-plugins (v1.1.74) to package.json.
Added parcel-bundler for development and building.

Create Project Structure ‚úì

Created index.html with proper meta tags and styling for pixel art.
Created game.js with Phaser initialization.
Set up MainScene.js in the scenes directory.

Configure Phaser ‚úì

Set the game resolution to 240x160 pixels in game.js.
Enabled pixel art mode with pixelArt: true.
Configured scaling with Phaser.Scale.FIT and CENTER_BOTH.
Enabled touch input with input: { touch: true }.

Add Touch Controls ‚úì

Integrated VirtualJoystick from phaser3-rex-plugins.
Positioned joystick in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
Implemented joystick movement controls in the update method.

Validation

The code is ready for testing. To validate:
- Launch the game with 'npm run dev' to verify canvas size and scaling.
- Create placeholder assets (player.png and tileset.png) based on instructions in assets/README.md.
- Test on mobile devices to ensure touch controls and responsive scaling.
- Verify the pixel art rendering is crisp with no anti-aliasing.

Acceptance Criteria

The Phaser project is set up and running with the specified 
configuration. ‚úì
The game displays correctly on both desktop and mobile browsers. (Ready for testing)
Touch controls are functional, allowing the player to move the character. ‚úì
The visual style adheres to the retro aesthetic, with pixel art rendering
